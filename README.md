# Kreol(Morisien) to English translation program using NMT (seq2seq)
#### This project is an attempt at building a decent translation program for kreol to english and vice versa using a seq2seq model.



##### Translation.py -> Main python file to train, configure and to test the model.

##### preprocess.py -> to prepare the dataset to be used to train the model.

##### prepreprocess.py -> used if the translation dataset is separated in two files.
